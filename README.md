# HR EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION

### Project Overview

HR employee distribution report is a project that aims to analyse the spread of employees within a particular company 
by department, race and work environment/location over a period of years (2000-2020). This project was a challenging one
for me especially as a Biotechnologist who transitioned into tech (Data analysis), especially with the tools employed
for this analysis which are MySQL and Power BI tools. though the project was challenging as I earlier stated but at the
same time it was an interesting journey as it help to solidify my learning process.

Finally, this project contain the visual report of the analysis and the SQL queries written with the questions answered
while working on the project.
