# HR EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION

### Project Overview

HR employee distribution report is a project that aims to analyse the spread of employees within a particular company 
by department, race and work environment/location over a period of years (2000-2020). This project was a challenging one
for me especially as a Biotechnologist who transitioned into tech (Data analysis), especially with the tools employed
for this analysis which are MySQL and Power BI tools. though the project was challenging as I earlier stated but at the
same time it was an interesting journey as it help to solidify my learning process.

Finally, this project contain the visual report of the analysis and the SQL queries written with the questions answered
while working on the project.


### Data Sources
HR Data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Human_Resources.csv" file, containing detailed information about each employee either terminated/currently working in the company.

### Tools
- SQL - Data cleaning and Analysis
- Power BI - Data visualization

### Data Cleaning/preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. data loading and inspection
2. changed column name
3. Added a column
4. Data cleaning and Formatting
5. Data Analysis proper.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the HR employee data to answer key questions such as:

- What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company
- What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company
- What is the age distribution of employees in the company
- How many employees work at the headquarters versus remote location
- What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated
- How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles
- What is the distribution of job titles across the company
- What department has the highest turnover rate
- What is the distribution of employees across location by city and state
- How has the company's employees count changed over time based on hire or termdates
- What is the tenure distribution for each department
